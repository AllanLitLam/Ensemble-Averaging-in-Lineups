# Ensemble-Averaging-in-Lineups

Ensemble perception, the automatic extraction of summary statistics from a group of similar objects, may influence eyewitness identifications in police lineups, which consist of similar faces. Leveraging ensemble information theoretically enhances an eyewitness’s ability to discriminate innocent from guilty suspects. The availability of more precise ensemble information in simultaneous lineups may help to explain why presenting faces simultaneously often enhances discriminability compared to sequential presentation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether presenting six study faces simultaneously or sequentially influenced participants’ ability to discriminate an “old” ensemble morph (the average of the six studied faces) from a “new” ensemble morph (the average of six unstudied but similar faces). Across four experiments, we found that the simultaneous presentation of faces did enhance ensemble morph discriminability.
